    problem 006 - sum square difference
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    :description:
    the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
        12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

    the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

    hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
    first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is,
        3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
    first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
